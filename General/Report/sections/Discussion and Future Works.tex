\section{Discussion and Future Works}
The model showed promising results, however there is some room for improvement. The improvements we think are most logical as the next step are presentedin this section, ranked after importance:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Improve accuracy of labels for imperfect data}
  \item \textbf{More diverse training data}
  \item \textbf{}
\end{enumerate}
